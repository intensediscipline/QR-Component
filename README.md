## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Setting the body height of the page was useful to center the design.

```css
html,
body {
  height: 100%;
}
```

Used Flexbox on the body to control the positioning of the card div.

Also, learned alot about the git process just by following this challenge.

### Continued development

Will learn more about Flexbox and Grid to see advantages and benefits of each.

### Useful resources

- [Pixels to Rems](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) - This helped me with converting pixels sizes for fonts
